- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This small but really cool project has taught me a lot and helped me to practice my newly learned React skills. I've worked with class components before, but working with function components seems to be a lot cooler. The code is more concise and easy readable. When building stuff with Vanilla JS, I was used to making everything by myself, however, now that's not the case anymore. It's not that I stopped liking making things by myself, but I think that I don't have to know how to write a code that'll generate a QR code, when I can easily add that functionality in my React project. This is just the beginning, but I can surely say that I already like working with React a lot!

### Continued development

Since this was a small project and didn't have a lot of components involved, I didn't do much in terms of file structure. However, for the future projects I'm going to pay closer attention to that and to some other things as well.

### Useful resources

- [QR code API](https://goqr.me/api/) - Simplest QR code generator that helped me to build this cool project.
- [filesaver.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) - If you're looking for a JS filer saver, this is my recommendation.
- [copytoclipboard.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-copy-to-clipboard) - In case if you were wondering, this is what I used for the embed button to copy to clipboard the link of the QR code.
